Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator

I’m creating these notes as part of my LFCS exam preparations. I followed multiple tutorials and books for preparing this exam. 
LFCS is one of the best exams with hands on lab. You should be very familiar Linux command line and use of multiple Linux features to pass this exam.
I’m using RHEL7.x Operating System for my day to day task at office, even though I’m not a System Administrator. But after spending 5+ years with RHEL 7.x and now with RHEL8.x, I thought it is nice to have a Certification in Linux. I know there are Certifications based on Redhat Linux, but I prefer to get a certification from Linux Foundation.

The notes will be based on LFCS study guide. You can get that from Linux Foundation website.
